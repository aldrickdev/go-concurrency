# Golang Concurrency

This repo is based on the Rob Pike video on Golang's Concurrency patterns called:
[Google I/O 2012 - Go Concurrency Patterns](https://youtu.be/f6kdp27TYZs).

## Sections

- [Non Concurrent](https://github.com/aldrickdev/go-concurrency/blob/1.non-concurrent/main.go)  
This branch just has a simple project that doesn't take advantage of go routines or channels.

- [Go Routine](https://github.com/aldrickdev/go-concurrency/blob/2.run-in-background/main.go)  
Here we can see how to use go routines to run functions in the background.
